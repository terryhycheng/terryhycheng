A passionate **Full-stack Junior Web Developer** specialising in the front-end.

After working as a graphic designer in marketing agencies for 5 years, I spent 2 years at The University of Hong Kong as an IT officer, building websites and systems with well-designed UI. I enjoyed turning my designs into actual useable applications, so I decided to enhance my coding skills and even change my career to be a developer.

Having recently completed the intensive 16-week bootcamp at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/), I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent and confident junior developer.

I am currently looking for a role where I can combine creativity with a super high level of technical knowledge and expand my knowledge in Full-Stack and Front-End development and design.

**Tech Skills** : HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, TailwindCSS, Express, Node.js, NextJS, Ruby, Rails

## Skills

#### Passionate in design

Organising elements to create beautiful layouts has always been my passion. After graduating, I worked in the design industry for over 6 years. During this time, I gained experience and additional skills that took me from a passionate graduate to a professional designer. I believe all these experiences and skill sets would be a booster while working in front-end development.

#### Keen to details

From designing a poster while working in marketing agencies, to developing a programming while studying in Makers. Detail always plays a key role towards perfection. I believe every detail can make a difference so being detail-oriented is so important for me either as a designer or developer.

#### Well balance between aesthetics and logic

#### Thrives under pressure

When I was working in marketing agencies, having a tight production timeline with multiple projects on hand at the same time are a normal practice. The team leaders from my previous jobs were impressed by my high efficiency and also the quality of my, even though working under high pressure.

#### Fast and motivated learner

####

During my time at Agenda, I presented to clients about our design concepts, with well-deisgned presentation decks and marketing data provided by other teams. I have continued to develop my written communication skills by [blogging](https://terryhycheng.hashnode.dev/) about my journey of learning to code and I use it to develop a stronger online presence.

- Methodologies : Agile, XP, Test Driven Development
- Foreign languages : Fluent Cantonese, Madarian and basic Japanese
